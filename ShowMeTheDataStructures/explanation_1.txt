Explanation for Task 1 - LRU Cache:

My LRU Cache solution was implemented with doubly linked nodes that are stored in a queue and dictionary:
- Dictionary (cache_map): Has the given key and stores a node as value
- Queue (lru_queue): Holds all elements that are currently in the cache (max 5). At the tail is the most recently used element.
                     At the head is the least recently used element, that will be the next candidate to remove.

The get-operation retrieves the node from the map (for valid not-None keys) and checks whether there's a cache hit or cache miss.
In case of a cache hit, the node must be upgraded: It is put to the tail (upgrade_node).
Map lookup is a constant operation --> O(1)

upgrade_node takes a node from somewhere inside the queue and promotes it to the tail. This is actually an O(1) operation 
as the node is referenced to by the cache_map and all node calls are also constant operations.

The set-operation checks whether an element is present in the cache (this is again an O(1) operation - dict lookup).
If present, the value is simply overridden. If the element isn't present it is inserted into queue and dict after removing
the least recently used element when the cache is at capacity. Enqueue & dequeue operations as well as dict access and deletion are O(1) operations.

All operations are performed in constant time, even in the worst case. This can be accomplished thanks to possibility to access
elements somewhere in the queue through a dictionary. All other operations are constant by nature (enqueue, dequeue, dict deletion & lookup..).
