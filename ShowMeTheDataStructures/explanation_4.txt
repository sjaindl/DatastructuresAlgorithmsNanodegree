Explanation for Task 4 - Active Directory:

This simple recursive algorithm checks first the base case: Is the user in current group?
If not, the check is done recursively for all subgroups and the result is returned.

The runtime is O(m * n), where m is the number of users and n the number of groups. 
In the worst case all groups and users have to be checked. There is also a call stack overhead due to the recursion.

The space complexity is also O(m * n), because of the recursive call stack (users and groups are passed in as parameters.)

There are no additional data structures necessary.
