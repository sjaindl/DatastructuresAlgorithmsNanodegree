Explanation for Task 3 - Huffman Coding:

Encoding:
The Huffman encoding first uses a dictionary to store frequencies of single characters in the input string. This needs time and
space of O(n), since all characters need to be checked and dictionary insert and lookup can be done in O(1).

Next, characters are sorted by frequency. This can easily be done with a priority queue as the min/max element is always on top
of the queue. pq.get() takes therefore O(1) only time, the put operations takes O(log n) time, as a priority queue sorts internally.
So, this a runtime of O(n log n), as a put operation is performed for each character once.

Then, the tree is build starting from the root in codes_rec. This is a recursive function that stores char prefixes in another dictionary by traversing the tree.
All elements are traversed once, so this has a time complexity of O(n). There may be a bit of overhead because of the recursive call stack.

Finally, encoded data is build by looking up each character in the code dict. This is O(n).

Total Time: O(n) + O(n log n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n log n)!

Decoding:
All characters in the decoded data are iterated through and, when a leave is reached, decoded data is looked up by the custom class CharTuple, that represents the tree elements.
This is a runtime of O(n).
