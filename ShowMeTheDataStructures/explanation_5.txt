Explanation for Task 5 - Blockchain:

The Blockchain solution has 3 classes:
- Node: Containing a block, linking to previous node
- Block: Containing data, timestamp a hash and hash of previous block
    --> The calc_hash function called in the constructor which probably takes O(n) time, as each char of the input must be considered in the hash function.
- BlockChain: The blockchain holds a single linked list with tail and head. 
    --> The add_block method creates a block and puts it in the linked list. The method itself has only constant O(1) time operations, except
        calling the block constructor, which calculates a hash.

Altogether, space (linked list) and time complexity are O(n). Time complexity depends on the hash function.
