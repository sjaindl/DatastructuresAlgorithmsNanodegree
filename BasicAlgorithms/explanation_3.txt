Explanation for Task 3 - Rearrange Array Elements:

The implementation first inserts all elements in a min priority queue. This means the smallest element always can be retrieved.
Then, the goal is to put the smallest digits on the smallest unit positions and the largest digits on the highest unit positions. 
So, next the elements are removed from the queue and added to the left and right number. 

Time complexity: O(n log n) for inserting all elements in the priority queue + O(n log n) for removing all elements from the priority queue again. Total: O(n log n).
Space complexity: O(n) for the priority queue, containing n elements.
